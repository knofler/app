# 26-git-fleet-preflight.sh — MACHINE ARRIVAL boot preflight
# (plan/MYTHOS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md Track 2 #5 / plan/schedule.json).
#
# PAST INCIDENT this guards against: a Mac returned after 7 weeks with every
# repo's .git missing, and nothing at boot said so — it was discovered hours
# into the session. scripts/restore_git_metadata.sh --fleet (dry-run, its
# default) already has everything needed to catch this: it walks the whole
# fleet roster and reports any repo missing .git plus any that cannot resolve
# a remote. This hook is just the wiring: run that dry-run at session start
# and surface findings before any other work happens.
#
# Contract:
#   - all repos attached  -> ZERO output (this hook, and the whole session
#     boot, stays quiet — nothing to act on)
#   - a repo missing .git -> names the repo and the exact fix command
#   - never writes anything (the underlying script defaults to dry-run; this
#     hook never passes --apply)
#
# Host-only, like the sibling machine-switch hooks: a container guest has no
# Dropbox-synced fleet of sibling repos to check.
#
# MYAI_FORCE_HOST=1 overrides the guard. This exists because the self-hosted
# CI runner (`runs-on: [self-hosted, myai-local]`) IS a container, so
# /.dockerenv is always present there and the host-only path could never be
# exercised — scripts/tests/test_git_fleet_preflight.sh's 7 host-mode
# assertions failed on every CI run while passing locally. The override is
# opt-in and set only by that test; nothing on the real boot path sets it, so
# a genuine container guest still exits here exactly as before.
